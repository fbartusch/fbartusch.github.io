title: "Containerization of Galaxy Workflows increases Reproducibility"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-08-18-Containerization-of-Galaxy-Workflows
excerpt: 'Published scientific findings supported by computational experiments should be reproducible by following the methodical description in the publication. Because this is often not the case, we present a method to containerize Galaxy workflows within Singularity containers. These containers are executable such that other researchers can reproduce computational experiments or run their own experiments using the containerized workflows.'

Published scientific findings supported by computational experiments should be reproducible by following the methodical description in the publication. Because this is often not the case, we present a method to containerize Galaxy workflows within Singularity containers. These containers are executable such that other researchers can reproduce computational experiments or run their own experiments using the containerized workflows.
