BinAC provides central high performance computing capacities for bioinformati-
cians and astrophysicists from the state of Baden-Württemberg. The bwForCluster
BinAC is part of the implementation concept for scientific computing for the uni-
versities in Baden-Württemberg. Community specific support is offered through the
bwHPC-C5 project.
