excerpt: 'The importance of software and web services is changing. So it sufficed to state the software used during scientific data processing, when publishing results in journals. This also applies to web services, which can be methods used in scientific work as well as results of this work. Awareness for the evanescence of tools and services, which hinders the reproducibility of published work, increases. Similar to data repositories, which archive datasets and make them citable, a service for software artifacts would enhance sustainability of science. So we present the CiTAR (Citing & Archiving Research) service in this paper, which enables researches to preserve computational environments and make them citable. In contrast to pure data repositories, CiTAR guarantees the executability of archived environments by providing generic runtimes.'
