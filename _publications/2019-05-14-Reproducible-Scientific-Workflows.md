title: "Reproducible scientific workflows for high performance and cloud computing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-05-14-Reproducible-Scientific-Workflows
excerpt: 'Many complex data analysis tasks are performed by scientific workflows and pipelines deployed on high performance computing (HPC) or cloud computing resources. The complex software stack required by a workflow and unnoticed dependencies can make the deployment of a pipeline a demanding task. Once deployed, workflows tend to be black boxes, especially for users that did not create the pipeline themselves. At the end of a project a researcher should archive the pipeline in order to ensure reproducibility of published results. This paper illustrates a possible solution for each of the three tasks: reproducible deployment via software containers, automated generation of provenance information to break black boxes, and using the CiTAR service for archiving software containers.'
